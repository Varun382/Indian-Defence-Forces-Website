        The Indian Army is the land-based branch and the largest component of
        the Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the Supreme Commander
        of the Indian Army, and its professional head is the Chief of Army
        Staff, who is a four-star general. Two officers have been conferred with
        the rank of field marshal, a five-star rank, which is a ceremonial
        position of great honour. The Indian Army originated from the armies of
        the East India Company, which eventually became the British Indian Army,
        and the armies of the princely states, which were merged into the
        national army after independence. The units and regiments of the Indian
        Army have diverse histories and have participated in several battles and
        campaigns around the world, earning many battle and theatre honours
        before and after Independence.
